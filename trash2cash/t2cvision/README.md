# t2cvision

This is an AI project Iâ€™m building to help solve a very real problem in developing countries â€” waste management and recycling. The idea is simple: use computer vision to identify different types of trash (plastic, nylon, cans, etc.) so that people can automatically exchange waste for cash at smart outlets.

The bigger picture here is a recycling system powered by AI â€” one where people drop their waste into a machine, and it detects, sorts, and rewards them instantly. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m working toward with Trash2Cash (T2C), and `t2cvision` is the brain that will power it.

## What Iâ€™ve Done So Far

* âœ… Set up the folder structure and environment using TensorFlow/Keras.
* âœ… Collected and organized the [TrashNet dataset](https://github.com/garythung/trashnet).
* âœ… Built and trained a basic CNN model to classify trash images.
* âœ… Created preprocessing scripts for image resizing and augmentation.

## Where Itâ€™s At Now

The model runs and trains, but honestly â€” the accuracy isnâ€™t there yet. Itâ€™s struggling to correctly identify trash categories consistently, especially between materials like nylon vs. plastic. Iâ€™ve tried adjusting the architecture and tuning the hyperparameters, but the performance still isnâ€™t reliable.

## Next Steps

Right now, Iâ€™m exploring the idea of **building my own custom dataset** â€” one thatâ€™s more relevant to local trash types in Nigeria (pure water sachets, PET bottles, local-style packaging, etc.). I think that will give me better results than trying to rely on datasets made for other environments.

The long-term plan is to integrate this into a real-world, AI-powered trash-to-cash outlet that runs smoothly with automation.

## Why This Matters

Iâ€™m passionate about using AI to solve problems that actually matter â€” not just building models for leaderboard scores. If this works, it can give people a real incentive to clean up their environment and earn a bit of income, while also improving recycling systems from the ground up.

## Tech Stack

* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras
* NumPy / Pandas
* Matplotlib (for training viz)
* TrashNet dataset (custom dataset coming soon)

Still a work in progress, but Iâ€™m fully in. Stay tuned. ðŸ‘€
